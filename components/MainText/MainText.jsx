        Alejandra Cruz grew up by the beach, but you wonâ€™t mistake her songs for
        breezy summertime fare.
      </h2>
      <p>
        She writes from the point of view of outcasts and misfits, bringing a
        new perspective and incisive wit to her tales of relationships gone
        wrong. With a smoky voice trained on jazz classics and a stacked backing
        band, she combines a vintage sound with modern material to thrilling
        effect.
